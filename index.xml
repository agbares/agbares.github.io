      <title>Spark Resource Calculator</title>

      <description>After optimizing a few spark jobs, I realized that calculating the executor memory space is an extremely manual process.
I decided to write a simple UI that calculates an executor&amp;rsquo;s on-heap memory space (e.g. spark/executor/storage memory). I might extend this in the future to also include the executor container&amp;rsquo;s entire memory space (e.g. executor memory, overhead, and off-heap).

      <description>Over the past year, I&amp;rsquo;ve been building a fair amount of Spark ETL pipelines at work (via pyspark). The complexity of the pipelines I build have been growing. Evidently, this complexity required a better understanding in Spark&amp;rsquo;s inner workings.
After a lot of reading, youtube videos, and docs, I think I have a beter grasp on Spark&amp;rsquo;s memory model. A lot of the information online can be quite confusing. And frankly, incorrect or out of date.</description>
